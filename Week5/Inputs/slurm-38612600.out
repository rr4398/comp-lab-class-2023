GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2018.3
Executable:   /share/apps/gromacs/2018.3/openmpi/intel/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /share/apps/gromacs/2018.3/openmpi/intel
Working dir:  /scratch/work/courses/CHEM-GA-2671-2023fa/students/rr4398/comp-lab-class-2023/Week5/Inputs
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -v -deffnm adp_T300

Compiled SIMD: None, but for this host/run AVX_512 might be better (see log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

Source file: src/gromacs/domdec/domdec.cpp (line 6594)
MPI rank:    0 (out of 20)

Fatal error:
There is no domain decomposition for 20 ranks that is compatible with the
given box and a minimum cell size of 0.895375 nm
Change the number of ranks or mdrun option -rcon or -dds or your LINCS
settings
Look in the log file for details on the domain decomposition

Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned
a non-zero exit code. Per user-direction, the job has been aborted.

mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:

  Process name: [[31902,1],18]
  Exit code:    1
